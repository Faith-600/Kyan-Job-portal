Job Application Portal with React & Google Sheets
This project is a modern, responsive job application portal built with React on the frontend. It allows users to browse job listings, view detailed descriptions, and submit applications directly through a web form. The backend is powered by Google Apps Script, which seamlessly integrates with Google Sheets and Google Drive to create a powerful, free-to-use applicant tracking system (ATS).
